    <div class="- topic/body concept/conbody body conbody"><p class="- topic/shortdesc shortdesc">Crochet is the process of turning yarn, thread, and other materials into textiles
        using a single hook. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">The most obvious difference between crochet and knitting is the use of a single hook for
            crochet as opposed to two (or sometimes more) needles for knitting. While that alone may
            convince you that crochet is the simpler and better choice of handcraft for you, below
            is a list of crochet pros and cons to help you decide if crochet is right for you. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">Pros:</p>
        <dl class="- topic/dl dl">
            
                <dt class="- topic/dt dt dlterm">Easier to pick up and put down</dt>
                <dd class="- topic/dd dd">Crochet uses a single hook, which means once your stitch is made, it is secure
                    as long as you don't pull on your working yarn. In knitting, every stitch is
                    kept on the needles, and if your work falls off the needles, you have to
                    carefully pick each one back up. You'll likely drop a stitch, and have to undo
                    some of your work or even start over. With crochet, if your hook falls out you
                    simply reinsert your hook into the last working loop and keep going! </dd>
            
            
                <dt class="- topic/dt dt dlterm">Quicker to work up</dt>
                <dd class="- topic/dd dd">Crochet works up much faster than knitting. Speed varies by person, and can also
                    depend on your tools (ergonomic hooks can also increase speed), but crochet is
                    widely accepted to be faster. All evidence is anecdotal but crocheting a blanket
                    in a couple of days is commonplace, while knitting a blanket in the same amount
                    of time is unheard of.  </dd>
            
            
                <dt class="- topic/dt dt dlterm">Easier to fix mistakes</dt>
                <dd class="- topic/dd dd">Mistakes are bound to happen in anything you do, but thankfully fixing crochet
                    mistakes is super easy! With one working stitch, all you have to do is pull on
                    your working end to "frog" your work (the sound frogging makes sounds like a
                    ribbit!) back to before your mistake, and you're good to go again. With so many
                    working loops in knitting, frogging is unlikely to work very well. You'll have
                    to "tink", or knit backwards until you've undone your mistake. Again, more time
                    consuming! </dd>
            
            
                <dt class="- topic/dt dt dlterm">More versatile</dt>
                <dd class="- topic/dd dd">You can do almost anything with crochet! Amigurumi is the practice of creating
                    stuffed toys- it's ridiculously easy to make your own stuffed animals with just
                    a crochet hook and a single stitch (single crochet). Hand knitted toys are far
                    more difficult, and there are less knit patterns for stuffed toys because
                    knitting is just not the best way to make them. Crochet also allows you to
                    easily create baskets, bags, and more, while the fabric that knitting creates is
                    simply thinner and less sturdy than crocheted fabric, and usually works up flat,
                    so you'll have to sew pieces together if you want a bag. Crochet, on the other
                    hand, works both flat and in the round with ease. </dd>
            
        </dl>
        <div class="- topic/p p">Cons:<dl class="- topic/dl dl">
                
                    <dt class="- topic/dt dt dlterm">Uses more yarn</dt>
                    <dd class="- topic/dd dd">It is widely accepted that crochet uses about 30% more yarn than knitting.
                        This can be difficult for those with budget constraints, or who are bad at
                        buying enough yarn at once for a project (me, in both cases). However,
                        knitting requires more tools, as each pair of needles is stuck to one
                        project at a time, while a single hook can be used across several projects.
                        Anyone who does yarn crafts or knows someone who does also knows that pretty
                        quickly having to stop yourself from buying new yarn is the bigger issue
                        than needing more of it. If you want to use less yarn, crochet might not be
                        for you, but it's a great way to work through a big stash of yarn. </dd>
                
                
                    <dt class="- topic/dt dt dlterm">Not as good for colorwork</dt>
                    <dd class="- topic/dd dd">While crochet can make a much wider variety of things, it does lose to
                        knitting in the area of colorwork. There are may different techniques for
                        changing colors in crochet, but none of them give as clean of a look as
                        knitted color changes do. </dd>
                
                
                    <dt class="- topic/dt dt dlterm">Not everyone's aesthetic</dt>
                    <dd class="- topic/dd dd">While crochet's thicker fabric makes it more versatile, some people prefer
                        the look of knitted fabric, or find crocheted fabric to be ugly. <figure class="- topic/fig fig fignone" id="why_crochet__fig_txs_m5c_5nb"><figcaption class="- topic/title title figcapcenter"><span class="figtitleprefix fig--title-label">Figure<span class="fig--title-label-number"> 1</span><span class="fig--title-label-punctuation">. </span></span><span class="fig--title">Crochet Fabric (left) VS Knit Fabric (right)</span></figcaption>

                    <dd class="- topic/dd dd">Crochet has so many stitches you can learn that many people own a "stitch
                        bible", or a huge list of different crochet stitches. Knitting, on the other
                        hand, only has a handful of possible stitches in comparison. While some may
                        like the possbilities of so many sittches to learn, others may be
                        overwhelmed by the sheer number. Fortunately, you only need to know 1-3
                        stitches to crochet a wide variety of things! </dd>
